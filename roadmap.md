1. **Install Python and Kivy:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Install Kivy by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
     ```
     pip install kivy
     ```

2. **Create Check App:**
   - Design the user interface using Kivy's KV language or Python code.
   - Implement user registration functionality to store individual data (name, ID, etc.).
   - Add QR code scanning functionality using Kivy's camera module or a third-party QR code scanner library.
   - Implement attendance recording and local storage to log attendance data.

3. **Create Point App:**
   - Design the user interface to set up new meetings and generate QR codes using Kivy widgets.
   - Generate one-time use QR codes containing meeting/session details using Kivy's QR code generation feature or a third-party library.

4. **Data Export:**
   - Implement export functionality in the Check App to export attendance data in various formats (CSV, Excel, PDF).
   - Use Python's built-in file I/O or libraries like Pandas to handle data export.

5. **Internet Connectivity:**
   - Ensure that the Point App and Check App have access to the internet to generate and verify QR codes. You may need to implement network-related functions or check internet connectivity.

6. **User Interface Design:**
   - Focus on creating a user-friendly and intuitive interface for both the Check App and Point App using Kivy widgets and layouts.

7. **Security Measures:**
   - While Kivy provides some basic functionality for UI security, you may need to consider additional security measures for QR code verification and data storage.

8. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Regularly test your apps on various devices and operating systems to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
   - Perform thorough testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues.

9. **Deployment:**
   - Once your apps are ready, you can package them for distribution to users. Kivy supports multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.

10. **Data Privacy and Consent:**
    - Ensure that you comply with data privacy laws and obtain proper consent from individuals for collecting and storing their attendance data.

Throughout the development process, refer to Kivy's documentation (https://kivy.org/doc/stable/) for guidance on using various Kivy features and widgets effectively. It's essential to keep the documentation handy to make the most of Kivy's capabilities.
