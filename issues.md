Creating a contactless attendance system using QR codes is a great initiative for promoting safety and efficiency. Below is a high-level plan for implementing the Check App and Point App as described:

**Check App:**
1. User Registration: Allow individuals (students/employees) to register on the app by providing their basic information like name, ID number, and any other relevant details.

2. Data Storage: Implement a simple local storage mechanism on the app to store the registered users' data. This can be done using a local database or file storage.

3. QR Code Scanner: Integrate a QR code scanner feature into the app, which can be used to scan the QR codes generated by the Point App. Upon scanning, the app will match the QR data with the user's data in the local storage.

4. Attendance Recording: Once the QR code is successfully matched with a registered user, mark the attendance for that user for the specific meeting or session.

**Point App:**
1. Meeting/Session Setup: Provide a feature in the Point App that allows an organizer (teacher/manager) to create a new meeting or session for which attendance needs to be taken.

2. Generate QR Code: When the organizer sets up a new meeting, the Point App will generate a one-time QR code containing the meeting/session details. The QR code will be displayed on the screen.

3. QR Code Verification: As attendees enter the meeting room or designated area, they will use their Check App to scan the QR code displayed on the organizer's Point App. The Check App will verify the QR code with the stored data and record the attendance for the scanned user.

4. One-time Use: Ensure that the QR code generated by the Point App is only valid for a single use to prevent unauthorized attendance.

**Data Export:**
1. Attendance Logs: The Check App should maintain a simple log of attendance records locally.

2. Export Formats: Provide export functionality in the Check App to export attendance data in various formats like CSV, Excel, or PDF. This allows the data to be easily shared and used for further analysis or reporting.

3. No Complex Database: Since the system is not using a complex database, local storage will be sufficient for holding the user data and attendance logs. However, ensure that proper data security measures are in place to protect sensitive information.

**Additional Considerations:**
1. Internet Connectivity: The Point App should require internet connectivity to generate the QR code, and the Check App should require internet connectivity to verify the QR code against the stored data.

2. User Interface: Design intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for both apps to make it easy for users to interact with the attendance system.

3. Security Measures: Implement security measures to protect the integrity of the attendance system, such as ensuring that QR codes cannot be forged or duplicated.

4. App Updates: Regularly update the apps to fix any bugs, add new features, and ensure compatibility with the latest devices and operating systems.

Remember to adhere to data privacy laws and obtain proper consent from individuals for collecting and storing their attendance data. Additionally, conduct thorough testing to ensure the system's reliability before deploying it in a real-world setting.
